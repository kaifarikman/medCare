***In order for the application to launch, you need an Internet connection! Nothing will work without him(***

## Support and communication with developers

### Application developers on PyQt5. 

<p align="center"><img  src="qt/qtimages/images/amir.jpeg" width="50%"></p>

*****Amir*** decided to write the entire Backend of the application, writing various excellent working functions).**

<p align="center"><img  src="qt/qtimages/images/tagir.jpeg" width="40%"></p>

*****Tagir*** - made a sweet and beautiful candy from tasteless caramel, completely designing it in QtDisigner and choosing colors together with the designer.**

**They are very tired, so you can support them in telegram:**

### Creator of the idea

<p align="center"><img  src="qt/qtimages/images/raul.jpeg" width="30%"></p>
Raul - is the mastermind behind this wonderful application that you use to find medicines. Have fun using our brainchild!

### Artist
<p align="center"><img  src="qt/qtimages/images/shakira.jpeg" width="30%"></p>

Shakira - a genius of design and more, she not only came up with a thousand and one ideas for other projects, but also kindly helped her friends!

### Some facts

***Yes, yes. The application takes a very long time to launch, although we optimized it as best we could.. It‚Äôs just Python and we need to come to terms with it all.. Sorry friends, we tried our best***<br>

***When we launch the application, we already have a database with medications, which we took during initialization (and we took only 3 categories. If you want to take more, study parsing_site.py). Understand us, since optimization in OOP is very ‚Äúfast‚Äù, so also parsing... But parsing is written coolly)***
